# Rails learning hub

Ruby on Rails shines when you build something tangible. This hub highlights how to set up your environment, follow a project-focused curriculum, and reinforce good habits.

## Learn by shipping projects

BigBinary Academy&rsquo;s Rails course is designed around project work. You code from day one, building features that mirror production apps&mdash;authentication, dashboards, background jobs, and more. Every module mixes short lessons with hands-on exercises so you can internalise the framework&rsquo;s conventions.

### Suggested flow

- Begin with the environment setup walkthrough to get Rails, PostgreSQL, and Node working together.
- Follow the module order: models and migrations, controllers and routing, then views with Hotwire.
- Treat each capstone assignment as deployable work&mdash;write README notes, seed data, and smoke tests.

## Build your Rails toolkit

- Keep a snippet library of common generators (`rails g model`, `rails g controller`) and database commands.
- Practise the Rails console daily to debug associations and callbacks quickly.
- Use background workers for long-running tasks early; they encourage clean separation of concerns.

## Stay in sync with the Ruby layer

Pair Rails practice with the Ruby fundamentals in our [Ruby hub](/ruby/). Understanding blocks, enumerables, and metaprogramming patterns makes ActiveRecord scopes, helpers, and background jobs easier to reason about.

When you are ready for a deeper dive, browse the Rails articles on the [blog](/blog/) or pick a track from the [tutorials](/tutorials/).
