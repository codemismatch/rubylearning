Forget old manual compilation methods. Using a version manager is the standard practice in the Ruby community because it allows you to:

- No permission issues - install Ruby and gems without sudo
- Isolate project dependencies - keep your development environment clean
- Easy updates - simple commands to install new Ruby versions
