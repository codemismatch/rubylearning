```bash
gem install rails
rails new journal --css=tailwind --database=postgresql
cd journal
bin/rails db:setup
bin/rails server
```

### Practice checklist

- Install PostgreSQL locally (or use Docker) and confirm `rails db:prepare` succeeds.
- Swap Tailwind for another CSS framework and note the differences.
- Initialise a Git repository and commit the pristine app so you can track changes.

Continue to [Chapter R2: Routes & controllers](/tutorials/rails-routes-controllers/) when you can boot the app without errors.
