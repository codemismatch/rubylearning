# Ruby learning hub

Ruby rewards developers who start with strong fundamentals and practise writing expressive code every day. Use this hub to find the essentials, plan your study sessions, and keep growing.

## Start with the study notes

RubyLearning maintains a comprehensive collection of study notes that walk newcomers through Ruby syntax, object orientation, and idiomatic patterns. The lessons are crafted for people who want a solid foundation before diving into frameworks.

**Suggested plan:**

- Skim the introductory chapters to understand how Ruby treats classes, modules, and blocks.
- Work through each interactive example locally or in an online REPL—pausing to tweak and rerun code until the concept sticks.
- Keep the downloadable reference handy for quick refreshers on syntax and standard library nuggets.

## Practise with focused exercises

Pair the notes with your own experiments:

- Recreate the sample scripts, replacing method names and data to see how Ruby handles flexibility in typing.
- Set small daily goals (for example, “loop over arrays three different ways”) and log your findings.
- Share questions with the RubyLearning community or a local Ruby group to accelerate feedback.

## Build a personal Ruby playbook

As you progress, document patterns you rely on often—collection helpers, file utilities, and common gems. Treat the RubyLearning topics as checkpoints, and revisit them whenever you notice a gap in your understanding.
