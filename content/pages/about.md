# About Ruby Learning

Ruby Learning is the reference project for Typophic&mdash;the static-site generator we are building in the open. Every feature we ship to Typophic is tested here first, so the site doubles as a playground for contributors and a resource for new Rubyists.

Our goals are simple:

- **Teach by doing.** Every tutorial includes runnable code and clear next steps.
- **Stay current.** Lessons evolve as the Ruby ecosystem does. We revise content and add new sections regularly.
- **Open-source the platform.** Typophic&rsquo;s code and documentation live alongside this site so you can learn Ruby and peek behind the curtain.

## Who maintains this site?

The Typophic core team curates the content. We write Ruby daily&mdash;shipping production apps, mentoring newcomers, and improving the tooling that powers this site. If you have ideas for lessons or spot an issue, we&rsquo;d love to hear from you.

## How to contribute

1. Open an issue or discussion in the Typophic repository with your proposal.
2. Fork the repo, update the relevant `content/` Markdown or `themes/rubylearning/` templates, and submit a PR.
3. Run `typophic build --deploy` locally before opening the PR so we can review the generated output.
