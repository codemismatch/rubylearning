Daily practice compounds quickly when you treat Ruby exercises like a kata: repeatable, reflective, and scoped. Here’s a routine you can start today.

## Warm up with quick wins

Pick a problem you can solve in five minutes—reversing strings, scanning arrays, or parsing dates. The goal is to get your fingers moving and your `irb` session ready. Once the snippet passes, copy it into a notes file so you can revisit technique changes over time.

```ruby
def alternating_sum(numbers)
  numbers.each_with_index.reduce(0) do |sum, (number, index)|
    index.even? ? sum + number : sum - number
  end
end

puts alternating_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
# => 3
```

## Rotate problem types

Keep a checklist of categories—collections, file IO, concurrency, metaprogramming. Tackle a different one each day. The variety keeps you honest and uncovers blind spots before they surprise you in production.

## Reflect in a kata log

End every session by writing three notes: what felt easy, what surprised you, and one question to research. The log becomes your personal changelog and a source of future blog ideas.

## Ship your lessons

Turn the week’s highlight into a gist, a blog post, or a snippet you share with your team. Teaching reinforces your own understanding and gives others a jumping-off point.
