# How this learning path works

Our Ruby curriculum now lives in one cohesive guide instead of scattered blog posts. Head over to the [Ruby tutorials](/tutorials/#chapter-1) page to begin at Chapter&nbsp;1, meet Ruby in the console, and follow the chapters in order.

Each chapter gives you:

- A concept overview and runnable Ruby snippet.
- A short practice checklist to confirm you understand the idea.
- A pointer to the next chapter so you keep momentum.

If you landed here from an older bookmark, consider the original topics you may have seen:

- **Chapter 1** introduces Ruby&rsquo;s object model, strings, and numbers.
- **Chapter 2** covers flow control and collections.
- **Chapters 3&ndash;6** take you through methods, classes, modules, and working with files and gems.

When you&rsquo;re ready, jump straight into [Chapter&nbsp;1: Meet Ruby](/tutorials/#chapter-1). Keep the [resources page](/pages/resources/) handy for reference links, and explore the [blog](/blog/) for fresh Ruby and Rails articles.
