Rails rewards people who learn by doing. The project-based curriculum from BigBinary Academy leans into that idea: you start coding immediately, add features in realistic sprints, and refine each release with feedback loops.

## Stage 1 路 Set up your stack

- Install the recommended toolchain&mdash;Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, Node&mdash;and confirm `rails new` runs without errors.
- Generate your first app with Tailwind support, configure RuboCop, and commit the clean baseline.
- Build a quick health check route and deploy it to a sandbox host to validate the pipeline.

## Stage 2 路 Ship core features

- Follow the course modules to model data with migrations, validations, and enums.
- Build controller actions and policies that mirror real user flows, such as account onboarding or task management.
- Layer in Hotwire or Turbo interactions for responsive updates without heavy JavaScript.

## Stage 3 路 Harden the app

- Add background jobs for slow tasks, such as sending summary emails or importing CSV data.
- Write request specs for critical flows and document manual test scenarios.
- Instrument logging and error monitoring to catch regressions early.

## Stage 4 路 Reflect and iterate

- Demo the feature to peers, gather feedback, and publish a short post-mortem.
- Challenge yourself to refactor one subsystem (for example, move callbacks into service objects).
- Plan the next milestone&mdash;maybe payments, APIs, or admin tooling&mdash;and keep iterating.

Treat each project as portfolio-ready work. With a consistent build&ndash;review&ndash;refine loop, you will understand both the Rails conventions and the why behind them.
